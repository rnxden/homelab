    Configuration and documentation files for my homelab
  </b>
</p>

This repo contains all the configuration and documentation files for my homelab. This includes hardware specifications,
network infrastructure, tooling, applications, and more.

The configurations included are mostly for personal use, so a server provisioning guide will not be included. Due to the
same reasons, contributions will not be accepted. You may however, fork the repository and adapt my configurations to
your own likings if you wish.

Because I recently moved from a multi-node Kubernetes setup to a single-node Docker setup, my homelab is currently going
through a complete rewrite. I will provide a writeup on this topic later.
